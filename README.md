# elm-rocket: A Rocket Game

## Concept

In this game the player controls a rocket and tries to land it on a planet with gravity.

He has to land on all platforms in the given time.

Check out the latest build [here](https://chemmi.github.io/elm-rocket/).

### General set-up:

* The player can control the rocket via three possible commands: Turn left, turn right and accelerate.

* Landing is only possible on dedicated platforms.

* The rocket has to be at low velocity when touching a platform

* The rocket must not touch other objects in the world.

### Some optional rules to add later (or not):

* The rocket has a limited fuel tank. There are dedicated platforms to fill that tank.

* Other tasks have to be fulfilled before landing on a designated platform. (Perhaps different game modi??)
